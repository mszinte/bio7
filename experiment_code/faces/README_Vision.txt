# BIO7 - Vision Social Cognition 

## Task Description 
Backwards masking task of emotive faces (happy or fear) masked by neutral faces of the same subject, with a control condition presenting neutral faces masked by a different version of a neutral face of the same subject. Event-related design separated into 8 blocks of: emotive + responses, neutral - responses, split across 4 runs. = 2 blocks per run including 80 emotive task trials, 20 neutral trials.

Cue - emotion - Cue - neutral - ... ] block 

## Version Notes 
Version as of 13.10.2022. Fixation cross made to match Retinotopy task and resting state. FACES images used so that models mask themselves i.e., model-1 fear masked by model-1 neutral. Pseudo-randomised control of sex, age, emotion, number of soas across task. Locations fully randomised, 50% left-right - left vs right not controlled according to sex, age, emo etc. Text cues presented for 10 seconds before emotive and neutral tasks. 
changes v3 :
made neutral mask from image list b 
took run start time as trigger time 
changed keyboard button box left from a to q
modified rest experiment file to integrate different mask and target images



## Acquisition Notes 
BOLD Screen must be placed 30cm from the back of the 7T bore. Current codes as of 13.10.2022 for first pilot account based on distance of 30cm. 
Button response system must be put on HID, triggering of task occurs on every 5 volumes, only 1st volume is used to trigger. 


-------------- ## How to: ------------------


## Caution ! How to: Creating the task: 
- Don't run Emotion_Exp_Design_v3 unless want to create a new task design
- If you do, there will be a prompt anyway saying that there is already an existing design, do you want to not save the new one (0), save it but archive the old design (1), save it and delete the old one (2). Of note, can only archive the old design once a day as this uses a datestamp, if want to archive more than one copy a day will have to do that manually. At worst, if re-run and save will just be like randomising the same task trial order, if nothing changed within the config codes. If changing the task design and config files, will need to run this code after modifying the config codes to get the new design. 

## How to: Running the task: 
1. Navigate to folder Vision_v3
2. Run Emotion_Exp1_Run_v3
3. Input desired parameters: subject_number (1, 2, 3, 4 etc.) subject_run (1, 2, 3 or 4), subject_mode (demo/test on laptop = 0, MRI with BOLD screen = 1).

NB: - MRI mode will load dedicated workspaces and csv. files in execution/ folder or data/ folder if a previous run has already been run. Test mode will load files with _test in the name. 
NB: - The code will automatically check if existing data with the input parameters exist or if a previous run has been done. If previous data with the same inputs already exists in data/ prompts will be sent to ask whether to continue and overwrite data or stop. Options to save a copy of the matching data are coded but not working (13.10.2022) so should not be chosen for the moment - manually copy and deplace data if necessary. 

4. Trigger from MRI is 's', in test mode use 's' too, once 's' received experiment starts. Should see 'experiment triggered' in command window once trigger received. 

5. Response buttons are 'q', 'b', 'c', 'd'. Cancel button if want to stop task ever 'x' - only possible during emotive phase. Should see triggers and response buttons in command window if participant is performing task. 



----------- #### todo: 

Locations fully randomised, 50% left-right - not controlled according to sex, age, emo etc - should verify this in the design at the end - as each image is used 2 times, could do 1 time on left, 1ce on right?. 

Change the fixation cross: The moment during which you should respond is indicated by the disappearance of the dot at the center of the bullâ€™s eye.
